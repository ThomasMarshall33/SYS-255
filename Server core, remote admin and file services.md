* Accessing via Universal Naming Convention Path(UNC)
* The Universal Naming Convention (UNC) is a standard format for naming network resources, like files, folders, and printers, by specifying their location on a network. In Windows-based systems, a UNC path begins with two backslashes, followed by the server name, then a backslash, a share name, and finally the optional path to the resource, such as \\\\server\share\folder\file.txt. UNC allows users to access shared resources across a network, providing a consistent and simplified way to connect to remote locations without needing to map drives.  
* SMB" can refer to Server Message Block, a network protocol for sharing files and printers, or Small and Medium-sized Business, a category of businesses with limited employees and revenue. Server Message Block (SMB) enables client computers to access shared resources like files and printers from a server on a local network, while Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) are the backbone of commerce and are characterized by their smaller scale compared to large corporations.
