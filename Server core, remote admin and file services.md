Windows Server Core
* fewer resources needed
* less code == less vulnerabilites
* Windows CLI for automation
* Removes nearly all the interactive GUI(graphical user interface) elements
* Stresses remote management
* can do nearly all the things a full-fledged Server 2019 GUI server can do
* Accessing via Universal Naming Convention Path(UNC)
* The Universal Naming Convention (UNC) is a standard format for naming network resources, like files, folders, and printers, by specifying their location on a network. In Windows-based systems, a UNC path begins with two backslashes, followed by the server name, then a backslash, a share name, and finally the optional path to the resource, such as \\\\server\share\folder\file.txt. UNC allows users to access shared resources across a network, providing a consistent and simplified way to connect to remote locations without needing to map drives.
