## lab 01 | environment setup 

Step one: Open up the hardware page on the FW01 VM and change the network device (net1) to LAN 
network device net 0 MAC=BC:24:11:1E:60:65
network device net 1 MAC=BC:24:11:73:66:c8


Your WAN and LAN are either missing network configuration information or contain default IP addresses. So we are adding the mac addresses 


First, press 1 to configure the WAN and LAN, then make sure MAC addresses match up correctly to the previous MAC addresses, and also make sure vtnet0 is WAN and vtnet1 is LAN AND SAY NO TO SETTING UP VLANS FIRST!!!!!!!
Control H if stuck with consle



Wan setup
Steps 
Select 2 to Set interface IP Address
Select 1 to pick the WAN interface
Do not use DHCP for the WAN IPv4 address
Enter your Assigned WAN IP from the Network Assignments sheet in Canvas
You are using a 24 bit subnet mask
For the WAN, your upstream gateway is 10.0.17.2
Use the gateway as your IPv4 name server as well
We will not be using IPv6, respond no when asked about DHCP.
Press <ENTER> to bypass IPv6 configuration
Do not enable DHCP server on WAN
When asked about HTTP for the GUI, respond no (we want to use secure https)


Lan setup
Select 2 again to configure the other Interface's IP Address
Select 2 to pick the LAN interface
We are not using DHCP
Your LAN IP Address is 10.0.5.2.  This is the same for every student.
You are using a 24 bit subnet mask
You do not have an upstream LAN gateway (you are the gateway for the LAN).  Press <ENTER>
No DHCPv6
Press <ENTER> to bypass IPv6 configuration
Do not enable a LAN DHCP Server
Do not revert to HTTP
