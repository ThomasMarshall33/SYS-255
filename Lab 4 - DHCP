First, what you will need to do is download PuTTY, start up everything, then log in to ad01-thomas.marshall 

To download this program you have to go to Explorer 

To do this, go into file explorer and go to this pc, then Local Disk C 

Then the  program files(x86) and Internet Explorer will be there 

Look up PuTTY and click the link that is by chiark 

Download the top link. This should be called something like

putty-64bit - 0.83-installer.msi 

Now just follow the defaults for PuTTY

Once you have downloaded it you will need to open PuTTY

To do this you are gonna follow the same steps to open Internet Explorer, but instead of Program Files (x86), go into just Program Files

And double-click PuTTY and it should be in there 

then once PuTTY is installed(i will be refreing to it as pu from now on for ease) type the host name as dhcp01-thomas
